# I wrote a python script to upload articles to smol.pub

I wrote a python script to upload articles to smol.pub that can replace the smolpub.sh bash script.

It's still a work-in-progress, but so far it works both for posting new articles and for updating existing articles.
In fact, I posted this same announcement using my own script.

It requires Python 3.7 or higher, and requires that you have a copy of the library "requests" installed.
Plus, just like smolpub.sh, it requires that you have your personal token string written in a file called .smolpub under ~/.config/

If you want try it and tell me if it works or not.

Cheers!
